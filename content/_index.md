## 1) Neurodesk Play: Temporary session - no data is stored, no authentication required:

| Location        | Neurodesktop on play                                                                                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Australia East  | [start neurodesktop play](https://play-sydney.neurodesk.org/v2/gh/neurodesk/jupyter-neurodesktop-image/main)    |
| US West         | [start neurodesktop play](https://play-phoenix.neurodesk.org/v2/gh/neurodesk/jupyter-neurodesktop-image/main)   |
| Germany Central | [start neurodesktop play](https://play-frankfurt.neurodesk.org/v2/gh/neurodesk/jupyter-neurodesktop-image/main) |
| US East         | [start neurodesktop play](https://play-ashburn.neurodesk.org/v2/gh/neurodesk/jupyter-neurodesktop-image/main)   |


The Neurodesk-play instances above do not require authentication, but because of this do not store any data across sessions.


If you would like to keep your home directory across sessions, you can use the following Brainhack Neurodesk-Lab instances and authenticate via Github:

## 2) Neurodesk Lab: Persistent session - 50GB home directory - requires github authentication:

| Location        | Brainhack Jupyter Lab with persistent storage               |
